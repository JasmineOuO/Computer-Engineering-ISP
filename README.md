# Traffic Light System

A miniature model of a T-intersection traffic light system was built using foam board and paper. An Arduino Uno was used to control the LEDs, the IR sensor, a pedestrian crossing button and the servo used for the gates. 

Here is an image of a working prototype of the traffic light system:
